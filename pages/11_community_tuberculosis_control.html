        TB is a reportable disease in Georgia. All Georgia physicians, laboratories, and other health care providers are required by law to immediately report persons with confirmed or presumed active TB disease (including extrapulmonary) cases and latent TB infection (inactive TB) in children under the age of 6 years under their care to Georgia public health authorities. TB cases may be directly reported to a County Health Department, a District Health Office, or to the State TB Program and TB Epidemiology Section of the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH), which is responsible for the systematic collection of all reported TB cases in the state.</p>
