    <p>For TB control efforts, it is important that there be a smooth transition from the in-patient to the out-patient setting and close cooperation and coordination of activities among the wide variety of organizations involved in TB patient care, education, and TB control. </p>
    <p>Minimum criteria for discharge planning: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Patients should be medically stable and ready for discharge. </li>
        <li>Patients have been initiated on treatment with an appropriate anti-TB regimen (e.g., 4-drug regimen).</li>
        <li>A referral has been made directly to a local health department liaison for continuation of care and DOT.</li>
        <li>Patients have their discharge endorsed in the chart prior to discharge by the hospital social worker and the local health department liaison. </li>
