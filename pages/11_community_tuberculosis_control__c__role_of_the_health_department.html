        Health department staff are trained and experienced in contact investigations and provision of TB care and treatment, including directly observed therapy (DOT) of patients with active TB disease and latent TB infection (inactive TB). Consulting physicians with expertise in treating TB are available for consults by all districts. <b>DOT is the standard of care for all patients with active TB disease and latent TB infection in Georgia and is strongly recommended for all patients with tuberculosis to facilitate adherence and completion of therapy. </b></p>
    <p>
        Early reporting of presumed and confirmed TB cases is essential for control of TB and <u>is required by law</u>.Reporting gives healthcare providers access to the resources of the public health department for assistance in case management and contact investigation, and consultation with expert TB clinicians. Contact investigations are conducted to determine those who have been exposed to infectious TB patients so close contacts can be evaluated for evidence of active or latent TB and provided treatment as indicated. </p>
    <p>
        Tuberculosis services (radiology, medical consultations, DOT, etc.) are available in every health district. <b>All TB medications are provided by the state pharmacy free of charge. </b></p>
