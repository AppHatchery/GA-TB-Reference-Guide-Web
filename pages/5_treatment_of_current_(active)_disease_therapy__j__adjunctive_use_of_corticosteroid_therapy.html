  <p>Updated: April 2020</p>

  <p>Adjunct corticosteroid therapy is indicated in the treatment of
    tuberculous meningitis as its use along with appropriate antituberculosis drugs is associated with a lower mortality. For pa- tients with tuberculous meningitis, dexamethasone or prednisolone is recommended for a total of 6 to 8 weeks. An initial dose of 8 mg per day of dexamethasone for children < 25 kg and 12 mg per day for children > 25 kg and adults can be used. The initial dose is given for 3 weeks and then the dose should be tapered during the following 3 weeks. Adjunctive corticosteroids in treatment of pericardial tuberculosis did not reduce mortality, tamponade or constrictive physiology in a large randomized clinical trial and are thus no longer routinely recommended. Some experts would use corticosteroids in selected patients with TB peri- carditis: those with large effusions and/or high levels of inflam- mation in pericardial fluid.</p>
