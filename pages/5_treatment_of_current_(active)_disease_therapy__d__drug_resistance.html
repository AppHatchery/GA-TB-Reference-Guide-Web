  <p>Seek expert consultation for all patients with suspected or proven drug-resistant TB. Treatment of TB caused by drug- resistant organisms should be done by or in close consultation with an expert in the management of these difficult situations. INH-resistant TB is the most common form of drug-resistant TB (with a global prevalence of >10%). Newly updated ATS/CDC/ IDSA recommendations for the treatment of drug-resistant TB recommend the addition of later generation fluoroquinolones (i.e., levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) to rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the treatment of INH-resistant TB, although there are limited data on the benefit of the addition of the fluoroquinolone in these circumstances. Multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB is defined as resistance to at least INH and rifampin. New and repurposed anti-TB drugs included in treatment regimens have provided new options for the treatment of MDR-TB. As noted, consultation with an expert is required for MDR-TB and other drug-resistant TB cases. Second line treatment regimens often represent the patientâ€™s last best hope for being cured. Inappro- priate management can have life-threatening consequences . See Appendix and/or website for making contact with an appropriate expert in your county:<a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/district-health-directors">https://dph.georgia.gov/district-health-directors</a> </p>
